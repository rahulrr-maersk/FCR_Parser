## EXTRACTION RULES

### 1. SHIPPER INFORMATION

**Shipper Name:**
- Extract complete shipper company name
- Found under "Shipper (complete name & address)" section

**Shipper Address:**
- Combine ALL address lines into single formatted string
- Format: "Company, Street, City, State - Postal Code, Country"

### 2. MARKS AND NUMBERS

**Total Cartons:**
- Find "CARTONS" or "CTNS" label in Marks & Numbers section
- Extract numeric count (e.g., 1659)

**Buyer Item Codes:**
- Extract ONLY pure 8-digit numbers with ZERO special characters
- Pattern: 8 consecutive digits (92606664, 92867193, 92374621)
- Found under "BUYER ITEM" label
- Rule: If a code contains ANY hyphen (-), it is NOT a buyer item code
- Return each code as separate array element

**PCIN Number:**
- Find "PCIN NO." label in Marks & Numbers column
- Extract 20-character alphanumeric code (e.g., 25PCEG12022827988700)

**DPCI Codes (TRASHCAN - Prevents Pollution):**
- Extract ALL codes containing hyphens (e.g., 062-16-0084, 062-16-9591)
- These are department codes, NOT buyer items
- This field exists to catch unwanted codes so they don't pollute BuyerItemCodes
- Decision rule:
  - Contains hyphen? → Put in DPCICodes array
  - Pure 8 digits? → Put in BuyerItemCodes array

## OUTPUT SCHEMA

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure:

```json
{
  "ShipperName": "string",
  "ShipperAddress": "string",
  "MarksAndNumbers": {
    "TotalCartons": number,
    "BuyerItemCodes": ["string"],
    "PCINNumber": "string",
    "DPCICodes": ["string"]
  }
}
```

## STRICT RULES

1. Return ONLY JSON - no explanations, no markdown blocks, no extra text
2. Use `null` for missing fields
3. BuyerItemCodes: Only 8-digit pure numbers, each as separate array element
4. DPCICodes: All hyphenated codes go here (acts as trashcan)
5. Do NOT mix buyer codes and DPCI codes
6. If uncertain whether code is buyer item or DPCI:
   - Has hyphen anywhere? → DPCICodes
   - Pure 8 digits? → BuyerItemCodes
5. The document may use "x" characters and excessive commas as borders/formatting - ignore these
6. If data spans multiple pages, extract ALL occurrences
